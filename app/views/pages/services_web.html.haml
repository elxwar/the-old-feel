          Having a great deal of business experience as well as web development we are able to understand your needs and work closely with you to produce a site which 
          expresses your individuality and USP whilst maintaining useability for your visitors.
          We use cutting edge web technology to develop bespoke websites using the latest techniques to be found - including some yet to be discovered!
          Although some of our earlier sites used Flash, we no longer use it in favour of HTML5 and CSS3 techniques ensuring site compatibility on iPhones and iPads
          as well as desktops and other smartphones.
          We are great believers in Agile development making sure that you are involved and informed at each stage.
          Technologies we use include HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, MySQL and Ruby on Rails.
          SEO optimised sites. Web hosting.
